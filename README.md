# ATEK
SmallSandBox

This repository contains samples of codes made for ATEK Assessment Evaluation Process
**It is intended for a development environment.  Testing, staging, and ready for production repository are different and are not included in this scope.**

It is sub-divided as follow:
  1) libraries directory
     Contains all the shared/standard/common functions that can be used by any other projects (example: jquery.js and .css for JavaScript, or .h files for C or C++, etc..) - any codes included in these libraries MUST be already tested and approved.
  2) images directory
     Contains static image files (.jpg, .png, .gif, .svg, etc...) that can be used by any other projects - this eliminates redunancy and provided consistency in practice and esthetic aspects.
  3) videos directory
     Contains video files that can be used by any other projects.  Reduced redundancy and conistency throughout the organisation.
  4) src directory
     Further sub divided for each project in which contains all the source codes for the said project.
     In each project directory there are sub directories for each version/branched source codes
