Guidlines:

Each project MUST contain modular functions.
  1) In general, the main program acts like an conductor of an orchistra.  It calls individual function (module) to perform a specific task.
  2) Each function is a simple module which requires a certains inputs (parameters) and at the end of its execution provides a set of outputs (returns).

This structure enables
  a) resolution of complex problem by segmenting it into simple tasks
  b) modules can be shared with other projects.  Re-usability and scalability.  Tested and approved modules that are useful to others can be put in /libraries
  c) modules are easier for unit test.
  d) modularity enable better task management amongst team of programmers
  e) enabling quicker troubleshooting and support
  etc....

Each module (including the main program) must have a standardized header which contains: Description, Parameters, Returns, Usage, and other bookkeeping information
in compliance with various standards.  The template of the header is auto-generated on module creation to remind the programmer to mandatory fill in the missing
information.
The description (per example) can be generated by AI (example Coplilot) and reviewed by programmer to ensure it is accurate, etc....
